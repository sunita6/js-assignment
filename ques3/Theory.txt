Q3.Write a brief intro on available data types in js ?
->Data type 1)Numbers 2)string 3)Booklean 4)Null 5)Undefined
1)Number:In Javacript,the number datatype holds integer values it may or may not be in the fractional part.the number can represent any 
integer number or floting number also we can perform some mathematical operations on number datatype like multiplication,addition,subtraction
division and many more
syntax:let variable_name=value;
example:let a=1;
	a=1.1;
2)String:String in javaScript can be any alphabet char surrounded by single or double-quotes.In programming languages,the standard defination
of string is :string is a collection of char".similarly in javaScript too
syntax:let variable_name=string_value;
example:let s="shubh"
	et s1='i love coding';
3)Boolean:Boolean is a part of primitive datatypes in javaScript,boolean data type has only two values true or false.
syntax:let variable_name=logical type;
example:let a=2>1;
	console.log(a);
4)Null:In javaScript the special null value does not belong to any type of data.it only contains null as a value.
syntax:let variable_name=null;
example:let a=null;
5)Undefined:Just like null,the undefined makes a type of own,as the name,suggest it does not assigned when a variable is declared but the value
is not assigned that's mean it is undefined type.
syntax:let a;
example:let a;
